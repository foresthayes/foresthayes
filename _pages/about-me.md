Motivation
======

Unabated global warming and land development pose a tremendous threat to Earth’s biodiversity and endangers the ability for future generations to experience the wonders of nature that exist today. My overarching motivation is to address these problems and develop tractable solutions through enhanced understanding of wildlife communities. In following this goal, I have pursued a career in wildlife ecology and acquired a robust set of tools for field research, statistical analysis, and conservation.


Background
======

For as long as I can remember I have found the most gratification in spending my time outdoors, surrounded by nature. I owe this, in part, to my parents who fostered a love of nature from an early age. The first time I went on a backpacking trip I was small enough to be carried in a backpack. By the time I was mobile I was always looking for an excuse to get outside. I had the tremendous privilege to grow up immersed in the outdoors -- regularly camping, hiking, cycling and watching wildlife. Those experiences helped to shape my view of the world and laid the foundation for a deep appreciation of nature. I quickly gravitated to the joys of working with wildlife.

Since then, I have pursued a life that would allow me to work closely with and study wildlife. My enthusiasm  led me to receive a bachelor’s degree in Biology and Environmental Science from New College of Florida followed by numerous field positions across the United States working with taxa as varied as gopher tortoises, salt marsh voles, humpback chub, and bighorn sheep. I next received a master's degree in Wildlife Biology at the University of Montana studying moose resource selection, reproduction and neonatal survival of moose in Colorado. Throughout this journey, I have fostered a passion for research which has driven me to pursue a PhD, providing me with the skills and expertise necessary to lead research projects on topics that I am passionate about.


Aspirations
======

I aspire to tackle contemporary issues facing wildlife populations and the conservation of Earth's biota facilitated by ecological research. In my career, I am interested in studying mammalian communities at the interface of climate change and the direct ecological impacts of human activity. I have been inspired by numerous mentors and colleagues who have modeled how to design and execute impactful research, bolster public interest and engagement, and work broadly across organizations to accomplish research goals. Moreover, they have shown me that a single individual, and through team approaches, can positively impact the world.

My ambitions are underscored by my desire to make a positive contribution to our society while doing something that I love. These fundamentally stem from a desire to ensure the persistence of our natural ecosystems and the wildlife that rely on them. Our ecological systems are facing immense challenges, but they are not intractable. Large problems can be broken into smaller pieces, like the issues facing an individual species or population of animals. In my career as a researcher, I intend to break down these issues, tackle small parts of the problem, and thus contribute to the solution.


Collaboration
======

Building strong collaborative networks and leveraging individual expertise is fundamental to untangling the complexity of ecological systems under rapidly changing environmental conditions. Moreover, while science can inform conservation decisions, the ultimate decision is value based. I strongly believe that cultivating collaborations with rich diversity in background, culture, and thought is critical to addressing ecological challenges. I have had the opportunity to work with multiple universities, state wildlife agencies, and across federal agencies including the National Park Service, the United States Geological Survey, and the Bureau of Land Management. Through these partnerships, I have gained valuable insight into the many and varied needs for science to inform conservation efforts and policy. I am always eager for the opportunity to contribute to collaborative projects that foster meaningful research, leverage individual expertise and diverse experiences, and advance ecological research and conservation.

Mentoring and Outreach
======

It is crucial to foster the experiential development of professional and technical skills for upcoming scientists to meet the increasingly urgent and expansive demands for ecological research. As a field crew leader, I have mentored and taught technical field skills to numerous technicians. As a graduate student, I have served as a mentor to undergraduate students interested in biological sciences through sharing educational and career opportunities. Further, I have actively engaged in peer-mentorship of fellow graduate students sharing my expertise in study design, analytics, programming. As my own skill set and experiences continue to grow, I aim to share lessons I have learned and facilitate the creation of opportunities for diverse participation in ecological research.
