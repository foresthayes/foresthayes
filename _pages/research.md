<h2> Conserving biodiversity in a changing world </h2>

Rapidly warming climates challenge the persistence of many species as climatic shifts outpace species' capacity to adapt or relocate. Assisted migration offers one way humans can help species adapt, but concerns of introducing invasive species limit the practical utility of this approach. I investigate the value of translocated species and climate refugia and their role in the conservation of biodiversity.

<h2>Assessing impacts of climate change on vulnerable species</h2>

The same adaptations to cold temperatures that enable species to persist at high latitudes and elevations make them among the most vulnerable species to warming climes. This is especially true for edge and southerly populations which are most likely to experience a mismatch between cold-adaptation and local environmental conditions. I study how climate affects physiological responses using *in situ* observations and how species alter patterns of spatial use to mitigate high thermal exposure.

<h2>Wildlife responses to human disturbance and recreation</h2>

Recent growth in recreation and visitation to natural areas challenge existing infrastructure and lead to increased human-wildlife interactions. The location, frequency, and intensity of these interactions have implications for the distribution, behavior, and demography of wildlife. I collaboratively study the ecological dynamics of anthropogenic activity on animal populations across North America. This research facilitates the informed management of wild areas and reduction of human-wildlife conflict.

<h2>Novel interactions in climate-altered landscapes</h2>

Changing environmental conditions are increasingly resulting in species range shifts and novel wildlife community assemblages. Understanding these changes -- and resultant species interactions -- is fundamental to conservation of these populations. My research examines [competition over scarce resources](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2022.991714) and plasticity in prey-predator dynamics.

<h2>Leveraging technology to facilitate data acquisition</h2>

Incredible advances in technology (e.g., GPS collars, camera traps) have resulted in ever greater amounts of data collection. Despite their promise, the sheer volume of data collected creates another set of problems. I use cutting edge technology, such as the use of neural networks and artificial intelligence, to expedite use of these data.

Collaboration
</h2>

Inclusive partnerships and collaboration are essential to addressing complex conservation challenges. I am always receptive to -- and eager to participate in -- collaborative projects that leverage diverse expertise, knowledge, and experiences to advance ecological research and conservation.
