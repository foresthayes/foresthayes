<h2> Conserving biodiversity in a changing world </h2>

Rapidly warming climates challenge the persistence of many species as shifts in climate outpace their ability to adapt or relocate. Assisted migration offers a potential solution, but concerns about impacts of invasive species have limited use of this approach. My research examines the value of translocated species located within climate refugia and highlights opportunities for applied conservation through bolstering native populations and providing a buffer against rapidly changing climates.

<h2>Assessing impacts of climate change on vulnerable species</h2>

The same adaptations to cold temperatures that enable species to persist at high latitudes and elevations make them among the most vulnerable species to warming climes. This is especially true for edge and southerly populations which are most likely to experience a mismatch between cold-adaptation and local environmental conditions. I study how climate affects physiological responses using *in situ* observations and how species alter patterns of spatial use to mitigate high thermal exposure.

<h2>Wildlife responses to human disturbance and recreation</h2>

Recent growth in recreation and visitation to natural areas challenge existing infrastructure and lead to increased human-wildlife interactions. The location, frequency, and intensity of these interactions have implications for the distribution, behavior, and demography of wildlife. I collaboratively study the ecological dynamics of anthropogenic activity on animal populations across North America. This research facilitates the informed management of wild areas and reduction of human-wildlife conflict.

<h2>Novel interactions in climate-altered landscapes</h2>

Changing environmental conditions are increasingly resulting in species range shifts and novel wildlife community assemblages. Understanding these changes -- and resultant species interactions -- is fundamental to conservation of these populations. My research examines [competition over scarce resources](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2022.991714 "Species conflict at Earth’s edges – Contests, climate, and coveted resources") and plasticity in prey-predator dynamics.

<h2>Leveraging technology for wildlife science and conservation</h2>

Researchers are capturing more ecological data than ever before, thanks in part to the rapid expansion of remote monitoring technologies. While these data offer tremendous potential, their full value is often untapped due to processing and analytical challenges. My work leverages cutting-edge tools such as machine learning and artificial intelligence to make these data more accessible and to reduce human effort and processing time.

Collaboration
</h2>

Collaboration is key to addressing complex conservation challenges. I welcome opportunities to engage in cooperative research that leverages diverse expertise, perspectives, and skill-sets to advance ecological research and conservation of wildlife.
