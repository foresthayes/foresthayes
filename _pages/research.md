# Research Interests

## Ecological responses to climate changes

One of the greatest challenges to conservation of Earth's biodiversity is the unprecedented and unabated change in climate. Understanding how these changes in temperature, precipitation, and other abiotic resources affect wildlife is critical to guiding conservation decisions to preserve biodiversity for this and future generations. Through research, I aim to inform our understanding of how climate impacts behavior of and resource selection by wildlife and, in turn, affects positive conservation outcomes through enhanced understanding of resource needs and shifting availability.


## Effects of anthropogenic activity

A growing population coupled with increased visitation to wild lands and novel forms of recreation create uncertain effects on wildlife. Some of the effects of recreation are relatively well studied, such as an increase in stress hormones with human presence. However, as human behavior changes, the scope and magnitude of impact is unclear. Some national parks recently have restricted visitation by limited entry permits, but how these restrictions influence wildlife and how many people is "too many" poorly understood. Through study of wildlife in these systems, I am interested in understanding how anthropogenic presence influences habituation, stress, and use of resources within these systems.


## Spatial ecology

All animals use space; understanding which resources are important, how animals move across their habitats, and the impacts of changing resource availability is a foundation of effective conservation. Remote data capture through GPS receivers when coupled with advanced quantitative tools, such as Bayesian Resource Selection Functions (RSFs), allows us to study how animals use and interact with their landscape. I am interested in exploring how these methods can be used to inform proactive conservation through through mitigating contemporary challenges.

## Effects of climate and rapidly changing alpine environs on cold-adapted species

The reliance of cold-adapted species on high-elevation environments, which are rapidly changing, challenges their long-term persistence. Great uncertainty remains about 1) individual-level responses to local climate (e.g., ambient temperature), 2) potential for adaptive habitat use under temperature alteration, and 3) ongoing changes in landscape-level resource availability. As a part of this project, I am studying the effects of local climate on resource selection and physiological responses of mountain goats (*Oreamnos americanus*) in the southern portion of their native range. Using *in situ* observations, I aim to better understand the importance of persistent snow for cold-adapted species to reduce heat stress and how resource availability will continue to alter under projected climate changes.

## The influence of recreation on animal movement in national parks

Recent increases in visitation to national parks has challenged the National Park Service's (NPS) dual mandate of preserving natural resources unimpaired while providing access to current and future generations. The growth in visitation has raised concerns about the effects of human recreation on the distribution, behavior, and demography of wildlife. While both permanent infrastructure and human presence is known to affect resource use by wildlife, disentangling these effects remains a challenge. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many national parks temporarily closed to visitors, virtually eliminating human presence within the parks. This closure offered the unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the effects of recreation on wildlife in an experimental framework. As a part of a broader collaboration - spanning 17 national parks and including 11 mammal species - I am working to separate the effects of persistent human infrastructure and recreation impacts on resource use by wildlife.
