Forest Hayes is a PhD candidate in the [Gradate Degree Program in Ecology](https://ecology.colostate.edu), [Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology](https://warnercnr.colostate.edu/fwcb/) at Colorado State University. 

His current research centers on understanding (1) how large-scale changes in habitat and climate affect wildlife behavior, resource use, and interactions and (2) how anthropogenic activity and development influences animal movement, behavior, and connectivity.

Underscoring my research is an interest in developing novel analytical methods to leverage small data sets and facilitating data collection through the integration of technology with field research.Â
