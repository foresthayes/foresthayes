Forest Hayes is a research scientist and PhD candidate in the [Gradate Degree Program in Ecology](https://ecology.colostate.edu), [Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology](https://warnercnr.colostate.edu/fwcb/) at Colorado State University. [Read more about Forest's motivations, aspirations, and interest in collaboraton](/about-me/).

Forest's current research, in collaboration with [Dr. Joel Berger](https://joelbergerconservation.com), centers on understanding how large-scale changes in climate, habitat, and anthropogenic activity affect wildlife behavior, resource use, and habitat suitability. [Learn more about Forest's research interests](/research/).

Species that are elusive and reside in extreme environments vastly complicate empirical studies and makes data collection difficult. Forest has addressed these challenges through use of innovative technologies such as drones, high-density imaging sensors, and hierarchical models in a Bayesian framework. [Read more details in Forest's published research](/publications/).

Explosive growth of automated data collection presents an unprecedented opportunity to monitor, assess, and understand ecological communities. Managing and fully leveraging these data is increasingly difficult but can be facilitated through new programming and tools.
